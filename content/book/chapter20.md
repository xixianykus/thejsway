Understanding the fundamentals of web development is crucial for every JavaScript developer. Let's dive into this topic.

> Some of this chapter is inspired by the [Symfony PHP framework documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/introduction/http_fundamentals.html).

## TL;DR

* Data exchanges on the Web follow a **request/response** paradigm. A **client** issues a request to a **server**, which process it and sends back its result to the client.

* **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol), is the protocol that allows two machines to communicate with each other on the web. Its secured version is **HTTPS**.

* HTTP is based on textual commands. The HTTP **method** defines the type of the request. The main HTTP methods are `GET` to access a resource and `POST` to push some information on the server.

* An HTTP response contains a **status code** indicating the result of the request: 200 for success, 404 for a resource not found, etc.

* Web resources are uniquely addressed by their **URL** (Uniform resource locator). A URL is a text of the form `http://www.mywebsite.com/myresourcepath/myresource`.

* In a traditional web development scenario, user actions on a page trigger a full reload after a synchronous request to a server. Another web development model, nicknamed **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), uses JavaScript and **asynchronous** HTTP requests to fetch data when needed and update only the desired portions of the page. This enables the creation of **web applications**, aiming to offer the user experience of a native app.

* Cross-domain AJAX requests are only possible if the server has been configured to accept them by setting on **cross-origin resource sharing** (CORS).

* **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), a textual syntax for describing structured information, has replaced XML as the data format of the web. A JSON document is a set of name/value pairs.

## How the Web works

Surfing the web is easy as pie. Let's say you want to read today's comic from the popular web site [xkcd](https://xkcd.com). You type the text `"xkcd.com"` in your browser's address bar and voila, the comic appears (assuming no network issues).

Let's try to understand what's going on behind the scene.

### Web servers

To be online, a web site has to be published on a **server**. This is a special kind of machine whose task is to listen and answer to the demands of clients. A server that publishes resources on the Web is logically called a **web server**.

More precisely, a web server machine runs a particular software program (also called a web server) able to publish web sites. The most popular ones are [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [Microsoft IIS](http://www.iis.net/) and [nginx](http://nginx.org).

### Web clients

The machine asking a server for a resource is called a **web client**. Actually, the real client is a software program running on the machine. a well-known type of web client is the **browser**, a program specialized in displaying web pages. Famous web browsers include [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) and [Opera](http://www.opera.com/fr).

Not all web clients are browsers, through. For example, search engines robots and mobile applications also contact servers and ask them for content.

### Communications between clients and servers

Data exchanges on the Web follow a **request/response** paradigm.

![A web exchange example](/images/chapter20-01.png)

1. The exchange is started by the client, which sends a **request** to the server to access a particular web resource.
1. The server prepares a result for the request.
1. The server send backs this result to the client.

To understand each other, web clients and servers use a common protocol: HTTP.

## HTTP, the web protocol

HTTP, which stands for **HyperText Transfer Protocol**, is the technical foundation of the World Wide Web. It is a **protocol**, a language that allows two machines to communicate with each other.

> HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP.

Technically speaking, HTTP is a pretty simple protocol based on **textual commands**.

### Anatomy of an HTTP request

Let's study the first part of the web exchange described previously: the request.

![A web request example](/images/chapter20-02.png)

This HTTP request comes under the form as a multi-line piece of text similar to the following one.

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: xkcd.com
Accept: text/html
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh)
...
```

The most important line is the first one. It contains:

* The HTTP **method** (the request type, also named **command**). Here, the `GET` method indicates a resource access request.
* The requested **resource**. Here, `/` (root symbol) indicates a request for the default document.
* The HTTP protocol **version**, here 1.1.

The other lines of text are called **header fields**. They give more information about the client request: server name (`Host`), accepted content types (`Accept`), client software details (`User-Agent`). They are many other possible header fields.

The main HTTP methods are `GET` to access a resource and `POST` to push some information on the server. Other ones exist, such as `HEAD`, `PUT` or `DELETE`.

### Anatomy of an HTTP response

When receiving an HTTP request, the server looks inside for information. It then builds an appropriate answer and sends it back.

![A web response example](/images/chapter20-01.png)

The HTTP response sent by the server looks something like this.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 22 Apr 2017 18:05:05 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
<!-- HTML code of the page -->
<!-- ... -->
</html>
```

The first line contains the response **status**: a three-digit number indicating the request result. Other lines are **header fields** (`Date`, `Content-Type`, etc) giving additional info about the response.

An HTTP response might also include data. In this example, it contains the HTML code of the web page corresponding to the requested resource.

### HTTP status codes

The HTTP status codes belong to different families, depending on their first digit.

Family | Meaning | Examples
--------|---------------|---------
**1xx** | Information |
**2xx** | Success | 200: request handled successfully
**3xx** | Redirection |
**4xx** | Client error | 404: resource not found
**5xx** | Server error | 500: internal server error

### Addressing a resource with a URL

Web sites are usually accessed using their address, a piece of text of the form `http://www.mywebsite.com/myresourcepath/myresource`. This address can be split into several subparts

* `http://` means an access through the HTTP protocol.
* `www.mywebsite.com` is the **domain name** of the web site.
* `/myresourcepath/myresource` is the **path** of the requested resource.

An address like this one is called a URL, or **Uniform Resource Locator**. A URL uniquely describes a web resource and the way to request it.

## From web sites to web apps

### The web development models

In a traditional web development scenario, when you click a link or submit a form, your browser sends to the server a request that returns a full new web page tailored to your request. This model is subject to longer load times and limited interactivity.

Another web development model aims to avoid transmitting a whole new page for each user action. Here's how things works in that model:

* User actions on the page are intercepted through JavaScript event handlers.
* HTTP requests are sent to the server without interrupting the navigation on the page.
* Only the needed portions of the page are updated with the requests' results.

Albeit more challenging, this web development model can lead to limited resource loads, improved interactivity and a user experience nearly on par with native applications.

The set of technologies enabling the creation of web applications is codenamed **AJAX** (*Asynchronous JavaScript and XML*). An AJAX call is an asynchronous HTTP request made to retrieve or send data from/to a server.

### Synchronous vs asynchronous requests

In a **synchronous** exchange, the asker waits until he gets the needed info. A telephone call is an example of a synchronous exchange.

On the contrary, the asker in an **asynchronous** exchange can do something else while waiting for the completion of his request. Email is an example of an asynchronous exchange.

The traditional web development model uses synchronous requests: the web client is blocked while waiting for the server to complete its request. The AJAX model uses asynchronous requests: data is fetched when needed in the background.

### Cross-domain requests

For security reasons, many websites have a conservative policy regarding AJAX requests. This *same origin policy* states that requests are limited to their origin domain: `"http://mysite"` cannot send a request to `"http://anothersite"`. This prevents some servers to be accessible via AJAX calls.

Enabling cross-domain requests is done by setting on **cross-origin resource sharing** (CORS) in the server configuration.

## JSON, a data format for the web

The `"X"` letter in AJAX stands for XML, a generic markup language that used to be the standard for cross-platform data exchanges. While still in use, XML is quite verbose and tends to be replaced by JSON as the standard data format on the web.

JSON, or **JavaScript Object Notation**, is a textual syntax for describing structured information. As you'll see in the following example, JSON borrows heavily from the JavaScript object syntax.

```json
{
  "cars": [
    {
      "model": "Peugeot",
      "color": "blue",
      "registration": 2012,
      "checkups": [2015, 2017]
    },
    {
      "model": "Citroën",
      "color": "white",
      "registration": 1999,
      "checkups": [2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013]
    }
  ]
}
```

A JSON document is a set of name/value pairs. Name are always within double quotes `""`. Values can be numbers, strings, booleans, arrays or objects.

Many programming languages have native support for the JSON format... Including JavaScript, of course!
